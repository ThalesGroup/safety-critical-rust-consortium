        ## Submit a Tool to the Consortium
        If you maintain, sell, or use a software tool that would be useful to the safety-critical Rust community we want to hear about it. This might include statis analysis, hardware deployment, compilers, or libraries/crates.

        The consortium may publicize this tool on email publications, websites ([Are We Safety Critical Yet](www.arewesafetycriticalyet.com)), or at meetings. If we decide to move ahead with featuring the tool we will request more information about the specific uses of the tool as well as ask for a point-of-contact.

        However, we may also deem the tool as not safety-critical, not mature enough (yet), or unmaintained and decline to publish it. In that case we would be happy to reconsider the tool in the future as it develops.
